# reMarkable suspend

A bash script to automatically change the reMarkable suspend screen given an image.
It will resize the image to fit the reMarkable screen. It will ask for reMarkable ssh password.

## Usage
```
chmod 755 changeRmScreen.sh
./changeRmScreen.sh <input_image>
```

You can find some (cool) suspend screen in the images folder. Unfortunately, I don't remember where I took them (had them on my computer for a while) hence I can't give proper credit to the authors.
